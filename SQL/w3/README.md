sqlex.tar.gz - bases for PostgreSQL

The base can be imported in pgadmin:
1. Download and unzip the archive sqlex.tar.gz ;
2. Create an empty base with the name sqlex;
3. Right click on the new database and choose "Restore" from /sqlex/for_pgadmin_restore/sqlex
4. Errors during importing can be ignored. Schema and data will be restored (refresh the base).
