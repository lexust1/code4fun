# 17. The implementation of the Container class is given: class Container:
# """This Is a Container class.""""

# Create an instance of the Container class and assign it to the container 
# variable. Print the type of container variable to the console.
# Note: 
    
# The solution that the user provides is in a file named exercise.py, 
# while the checking code (which is invisible to the user) is executed 
# from a file named evaluate.py from the level where the Container class 
# is imported. 
# Therefore, instead of the name of the module _main_ , 
# the response will be the name of the module in which this class 
# is implemented, exercise in this case.

# Expected result:
# <class 'exercise.Containerâ€™>
# class Container:
# """This is a Container class."""
