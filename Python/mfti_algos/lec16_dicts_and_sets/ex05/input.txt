Dear president Blatter, colleagues of the executive committee. Let me speak from my heart in English.

My friends, today is an unique moment in time, both for my country and for FIFA. Russia represents its new horizons for
FIFA. Russia means a big promotion of our game. Millions of new hearts and minds it also means a great legacy after The
Worldcup. Great new stadiums and millions of boys and girls embracing again.

Russia's economy is large and growing. The Federal government has stable finances. Russia's sports marketing is
developing rapidly. Just one example: today russian companies provided over one billion dollars in sponsorship for the
Sochi Olympic Games. Imagine how much investiment would be made into football, given that football is sport number one.
Our bid is a national priority for the Russian Federation. If you give us a chance, FIFA will never regret it. You will
be proud of the choice. I guarantee it. I also promise this, in 2018 I'll speak English like my friend Jeoff Thompson.

Dear friends. You can see on the map. Western Europe hosted The World Cup many times. Eastern Europe never had the
chance. Many years ago the Berlin Wall was destroyed. And a new era for the world began. Today we can break another
symbolic wall. And open a new era in football together.

Thank you very much my friends.
